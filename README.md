# AltSchool Frontend Engineering Second Semester Examination Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Solved Exam Question 1

In this project, I used fetchAPI to make calls to GitHub API to get a list of repos connected to my username [Here](https://api.github.com/users/EmmanuelOloke/repos) and another [Here](https://api.github.com/repos/EmmanuelOloke/altschool-second-semester-exam) to get a single repo. Manipulated the data appropriately to get desired results.
